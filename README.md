### What I learned

I deepened my understanding of CSS background and filter properties. I learned how to effectively use `background-blend-mode` to overlay colors on images, creating a more dynamic and visually appealing design. Additionally, I explored the `filter` property to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation, which helped me fine-tune the visual effects of the background. These techniques allowed me to add a polished and professional touch to the component, enhancing both its aesthetics and functionality.

### Continued development

I aim to further enhance my skills in creating more dynamic and interactive designs. Specifically, I want to explore CSS animations and transitions to add subtle visual effects, such as hover states or smooth element movements. Additionally, I plan to delve deeper into responsive design techniques to ensure layouts adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. Integrating accessibility best practices is also a priority, ensuring my projects are usable and inclusive for all users. Finally, I’d like to experiment with JavaScript or frameworks like React to add interactivity and make my components more engaging.
